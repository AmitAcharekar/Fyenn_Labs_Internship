### :zap: [To analyze the fast food market in India using Market Segmentation analysis](https://github.com/AmitAcharekar/Fyenn_Labs_Internship/tree/main/Market_Segment_Analysis_on_Mcdonalds_data)
In this project we took MacDonald fast food datasets and analyzed the customer's purchase behaviors and using different clustering algorithms we did customer segmentation.

:diamonds:Result: As Segmentation analysis is an important step before we embark on a marketing plan. Hence it is important to learn how to analyze our audience and market. By analyzing the trend we observe patterns of  Indian customers regarding fast food which  shows immense potential and attracts huge investors. We found that the majority of customers who are in the age group of 20-30 are favorites to enjoy fast food.

### :zap:  [Market Segmentation on Electric Vehicles](https://github.com/AmitAcharekar/Fyenn_Labs_Internship/tree/main/Market_Segmentation_on_EV)
Problem Statement: To analyze the market of Electric Vehicles in India find the different types of EVs that are manufactured in India , find what are the availability of charging stations in states of India, etc.

:diamonds: Result: In this Analysis, I have found the total number of charging stations sanctioned in each state of India. Maharashtra has the most amount of charging stations in India. In India, two-wheeler vehicles are widely used by people for traveling and by delivery companies. From analysis, I have got that Maharashtra has the most amount of Electric 2-wheeler vehicles. As 3-wheeler vehicles are mostly used as public transport, Uttar Pradesh has the most number of electric 3-wheeler vehicles. I also found out which types of electric vehicles are available in India.
 (eg: SUV, Sedan, Hatchback, etc)

*Kindly go through the complete project report to obtain more information of the Indian EV Market.*

### :zap: [Holiday-Package-Prediction-main](https://github.com/AmitAcharekar/Fyenn_Labs_Internship/tree/main/Holiday-Package-Prediction)
Problem Statement: Predict which type of customer has the maximum chance of buying our holiday package.

:diamonds:Result: We found the cost required for marketing before and after the use of our model.

<h3>Cost before = NumberOfFollowups * cost_per_person</h3>
<h3>Cost after = ProdTaken_Pred * cost_per_person</h3>

Marketing costs required before using the model are <h3>56340 INR</h3>
Marketing costs required after using the model are <h3>7620 INR</h3>

So with the model we created, we can reduce marketing costs by 48720 INR or decrease by 86.47 %
