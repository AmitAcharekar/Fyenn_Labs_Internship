### :zap: [To analyze the fast food market in India using Market Segmentation analysis](https://github.com/AmitAcharekar/Fyenn_Labs_Internship/tree/main/Market_Segment_Analysis_on_Mcdonalds_data)
In this project we took MacDonald fast food datasets and analyzed the customer's purchase behaviors and using different clustering algorithms we did customer segmentation.

Result: As Segmentation analysis is an important step before we embark on a marketing plan. Hence it is important to learn how to analyze our audience and market. By analyzing the trend we observe patterns of  Indian customers regarding fast food which  shows immense potential and attracts huge investors. We found that the majority of customers who are in age group of 20-30, are favorites to enjoy fast food.

### :zap: [Holiday-Package-Prediction-main](https://github.com/AmitAcharekar/Fyenn_Labs_Internship/tree/main/Holiday-Package-Prediction)
Problem Statement: Predict which type of customer has the maximum chance of buying our holiday package.

Result: We found the cost required for marketing before and after the use of our model.

<h3>Cost before = NumberOfFollowups * cost_per_person</h3>
<h3>Cost after = ProdTaken_Pred * cost_per_person</h3>

Marketing costs required before using the model are <h3>56340 INR</h3>
Marketing costs required after using the model are <h3>7620 INR</h3>

So with the model we created, we can reduce marketing costs by 48720 INR or decrease by 86.47 %
